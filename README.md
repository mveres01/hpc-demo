These files are from a workshop on how to use Compute Canada HPC resources to train deep learning models. It assumes no familiarity with linux, and is composed of three different modules: 

1. Introduction to Compute Canada resources
2. Setting up a python environment through Anaconda
3. Practical experience on commands / pipeline for training a deep convolutional neural network

Jupyter notebooks can be found in the notebooks/ folder.
