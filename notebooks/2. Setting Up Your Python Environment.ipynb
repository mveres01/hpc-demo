    "# 1. Introduction\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "_Python_ has become arguable the most widely used language for developing deep learning algorithms and models. These models define a means to recognize patterns within data, similar to how we believe humans may do. These models allow computers to parse vast quantities of data, building representations in order to understand a scene, or even promote advanced capabilities in robotics, such as performing complex pick-and-place tasks with highly variable objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ability for deep learning to work with large amounts of data, however, is also a significant burden. In order to build suitable representations and abilities for understanding, Gigabytes upon Gigabytes of data are often needed for some of the more complex scenarios such as [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/). These models are often home to hundreds of thousands, or millions of parameters. Processing inputs until a model converges can often take an extremely large amount of time. Thankfully, both hardware and software have advanced to make development a more manageable task.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1. Deep Learning Frameworks\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "From the software side, a number of different frameworks have been built on the Python language to support the development of deep learning models. Key to the popularity of these frameworks is in how they allow us to interface with hardware accelerators such as GPUs for many common math operations. Popular frameworks include include (but are not limited to):\n",
    "\n",
    "* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) -- Google\n",
    "* [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) -- Facebook\n",
    "* [Keras](https://keras.io/) -- Google-ish\n",
    "* [Chainer](https://chainer.org/) -- Preferred Networks (Japanese Company)\n",
    "* [MXNet](https://mxnet.apache.org/) -- Apache\n",
    "* [Neon](https://ai.intel.com/neon/) -- Nervana (acquired by Intel)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2. Python Package Managers\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Many deep learning frameworks are built to interface with common python libraries such as _numpy_ or _scikit-learn_. In addition to these two, there are a myriad of others that one may choose to use during development to make the process a little easier. \n",
    "_Package managers_ such as [Anaconda](https://conda.io/docs/) are used to simplify the process of maintaining an environment or workspace. These environments are often associated with a specific project and python distribution. Consider the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You are working on a project that requires Python=2.7\n",
    "* You are working on another project in parallel that requires Python=3.6\n",
    "\n",
    "By using Anaconda to manage these environments, you can seemlessly switch between tasks without interfering with the global python instance. __It is a good practice to always create a new environment whenever you start a new project__. This ensures that any library dependencies you install don't get contaminated or changed when you want to try something new."
