    "\n",
    "The goal of this workshop is to gain familiarity with the high performance computing (HPC) resources provided by Compute Canada. The workshop will cover aspects of logging in, transfering data, initializing environments, requesting resources (CPU / GPU), and relinquishing jobs when you are done using them. To motivate the use of these resources, a deep learning model written in Python will be trained on both CPU and GPU, and the relative performances will be evaluated. \n",
    "\n",
    "A large amount of information in these iPython notebooks is summarized from the [SHARCNet knowledge base](https://www.sharcnet.ca/help/index.php/Knowledge_Base), and this [webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiAbxPZ3BHo&feature=youtu.be)\n",

    "* Compute Canada account\n",
    "* (WINDOWS) [Putty](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) for connecting to SHARCNet\n",

    "Compute Canada houses many different HPC clusters, which put simply are simply large pools of physical CPU / GPU systems configured in a special way. A list of Compute Canada nodes can be found [here](https://www.computecanada.ca/research-portal/accessing-resources/available-resources/). Each cluster is configured differently, and their configuration can be found on their corresponding wiki pages. For example:\n",

    "\n",
    "While recent versions of Windows have included support for many Linux utilities (for example, [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)), you may find yourself needed a seperate program to log in if the ```ssh``` command is not available from the command line. \n",

You shouldn't need to change any other sections, but note that capabilities such as port-forwarding and X11 forwarding are available if needed.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "When you connect to Compute Canada or SHARCNet, you connect to a _login_ node that serves as a sort-of centralized hub. Login nodes are the only nodes that have internet access, and are useful for tasks such as:\n",

    "\n",
    "## 2.1. Interactive Nodes vs. Non-Interactive Nodes\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "When submitting a job to the scheduler, you give it constraints such as the maximum running time (i.e. amount of you need a CPUs / GPUs for), and the amount of memory your program will need to run. Given these constraints, the job scheduler will find an appropriate time for your program to run on _non-interactive nodes_. If your program is found to have bugs in it (and it crashes during its alloted execution time), your remaining time will be forfeit and you will be tasked with fixing the code and submitting it for execution again. \n",
    "\n",
    "Interactive nodes on the other hand, can be used to quickly prototype code on a particular resource. You can request either CPUs or GPUs for a small amount of time, do some interactive programming, and when you're done relinquish the node and submit the job to a non-interactive node. Thus, it's extremely common to use both interactive and non-interactive nodes when developing models. An example pipeline is to: log-in --> transfer code & data --> request an interactive node to verify program runs --> submit a job. "

    "* The __/home__ folder is accessed by all users, and as such, should not be used for any extremely large datasets, or programs that frequently do a lot of IO. The more IO a program does, the more latency you introduce to the system, which causes network congestion and unresponsiveness. As /home is backed up, large datasets that do not frequently change do not need to be backed up, and can be stored on other partitions such as /scratch.\n",
    "* The __/scratch__ is fast access, and often the preferred directory for storing single-user data. However, files on /scratch will only exist for 60 days before they get purged. This means that if your program writes any files to the /scratch file system and you want to keep these files, you should move them once done. "
